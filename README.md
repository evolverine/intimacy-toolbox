# Hi!

Welcome. The page you're looking at is the tentative, and ever-evolving response to the question **how can we reencounter ourselves in connection and intimacy in a world of COVID-19 without leaving anyone behind?** There's no one 'solution', of course, but there can hopefully be space for learning, for getting clear about our values and some of our facts, and taking it from there with care and openness. If something evident is missing or incomplete, please [get in touch]({% link _pages/contact.md %}) and let's make this trip less rocky together.

# Pledge


I call it the pledge, but maybe "statement of intention" or even "conversation starter" can define it better. It's meant to help us get on the same page, which these days is invaluable. <a class="btn btn-primary" href="{% link _pages/pledge.md %}">Read the pledge</a>
