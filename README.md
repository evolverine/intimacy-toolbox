# Hi!

Welcome. The page you're looking at is the tentative, ever-evolving response to the question **how can we reencounter ourselves in connection and intimacy in a world of COVID-19 without leaving anyone behind?** There's no one 'solution', of course, and this page only hopes to contribute a partial tool of the many needed for the job.
If you feel something evident is missing or incomplete, do [get in touch]({{site.baseurl}}/contact) and let's make this trip less rocky together.

# The Undistancing Pledge


I called it a pledge, but maybe "statement of intention" or even "conversation starter" can define it better. It's meant to help us get on the same page, which is tricky these days.
