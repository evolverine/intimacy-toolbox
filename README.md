# <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">COVID-19 connection pledge v0.3</span>  

### <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">(pledge text below)  
</span>

## <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"></span>  

## <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Objectives of this document  
</span>

*   <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">To suggest a measure that may help us protect and support each other and ourselves. Not only in navigating the virus, but also through the psychological or economic hardship that may accompany it.  
    </span></span>
*   <span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">To help start a conversation with our loved ones about our live</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">s together in the age of COVID-19\. There is definitely no assumption that it can apply equally well to everyone, or that one has to agree with all the points.</span></span>  

## <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Target audience</span>  

<span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Those wishing to be conscious how and with whom they share intimacy, in order to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities from the risks of COVID-19.  
</span>

## <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">How to read the pledge</span>  

<span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Eventually the pledge should appear on its own website, and the current ideas for how it will be structured are:</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">The parts of the text marked with a larger font will likely be the only ones shown when that website loads, and the smaller text that accompanies them will be accessed by clicking on those main pledge items.</span><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"></span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif">In contrast, the text in bold in the acknowledgements section will be emphasized in some way, yet it will be shown alongside the non-bold text.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">There is a version number at the top of this document. This will increment as changes are made. From a more advanced, stable version onward, all the changes will be recorded.</span><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"></span>  

## <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">How you can help</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">By leaving comments on the parts that you think can be improved, regarding both content and structure.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"></span><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">By suggesting links (to articles, Wikipedia pages, news items, etc.) that illustrate the points made.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">By offering your help with translating the pledge (when it is in a publishable state) in a language you are fluent in. To let us know you are able to support us in this, please write an email to</span> 2a5464d3 at opayq.com<span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">, indicating the target language.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Through other ways that we can't anticipate</span> üôÇÔ∏è  

<span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Many thanks for your feedback!

</span>

## <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Because I can see and acknowledge that ...  
</span>

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">[**I am are more connected to strangers than it may appear**](https://youtu.be/X0mHf3oSUdU), and that my behaviours affect people far removed from my immediate surroundings;  
    </span>
*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">**My knowledge isn't perfect**, and [I'm likely to exaggerate it;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Our collective **knowledge about COVID-19 is evolving and changing rapidly;**</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">**People are affected by the situation in different ways**, to different degrees;</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">Pre-existing inequalities and oppressions that affect those in our lives, along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, education, sex, age, wealth, religion, political or ethical convictions, etc. might be compounded and magnified by the crisis we're traversing;</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">**Perceptions of risk are important**. While it's useful to allow the best knowledge I can obtain to influence my subjective risk perception, I can never know all the factors and values that entered another's assessment of risk;  
    </span>
*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">**Unless I and others are careful, it can be easy to exclude those most at risk**. For example, those who are currently suffering from COVID-19 might struggle with multiple limitations and hardships, as well as those with a higher perceived risk, who might see some of their social support gravitate away from them.

</span>

<div>

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">learning ‚Äî and regularly reviewing the quickly evolving information ‚Äî about COVID-19 and the recommended measures in my area.</span> About SARS-CoV-2 things like mean incubation time, mean number of days the virus has been found present in people's bodies, ways of transmission, etc. About my local context ‚Äî the recommended safety measures at home, at work, while socializing, etc.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">responding with gratitude when others point to information I didn't know</span>, and being open to changing my mind when faced with better knowledge</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">being open and gentle  in discussions</span> about "what scientists currently know", as I know that's a very fluid arena; about whether the relevant institutions have recommended "good enough" measures, as that's not at all easy to ascertain, even for those with extensive knowledge and experience.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">being thorough in verifying the sources of the information I pass onto others</span>, and in particular by not spreading information that I have not received from visible and trusted sources.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">deciding for myself which social behaviours feel reasonable and acceptable from and with others, given my needs, risk perception, ethics, and other relevant factors.</span> Things like physical touch, gatherings, measures at work, etc. Questions like what information I'd like to know before engaging in various behaviours, my own privacy needs, etc.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">avoiding initiating hugs, kisses, handshakes, or other close contact greetings with people</span> <span style="font-size:20px;"></span> <span style="font-size:16px;">unless I know their limits and risk management desires</span><span style="font-size:20px;"></span>.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:22px">asking about, and welcoming</span> others' limits, choices of interaction, risk perception, etc. And, of course, respecting them.</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">refraining from shaming or stigmatizing myself and others for their choices and needs</span></span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">refraining from pressuring myself and others into changing</span></span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:22px;">compensating the isolation and disregard</span> that some in my network are likely to experience, by connecting and offering to help with what I can. From calls to (physically-distant) walks, to help with shopping, to lending or gifting resources, to setting up book clubs, the sky is the limit. In particular,</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:22px">being proactive to creatively discover mutually satisfying activities</span>, especially with those at higher risk, or those with more limits and limitations to their freedom.</span>  

*   <span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif">being forthcoming about my own physical status</span></span> <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">when and where that's relevant. In particular,</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">getting tested, when possible and relevant,</span> (if I run a high risk, say, due to my work, or when relevant symptoms appear), and</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:22px;">communicating to my recent and future contacts when I develop symptoms</span> <span style="font-size:22px;">or test positive</span>*</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">communicating to my recent and future contacts when someone I've been in contact with has developed symptoms</span> <span style="font-size:22px;">or engaged in high risk behaviour</span>, as soon I am made aware, all while doing my best to <span style="font-size:22px;">ask about and respect</span></span><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"> <span style="font-size:22px;">the privacy needs</span> of all those involved</span><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"></span><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;"></span>  

## <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">So that together we may</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">enjoy each other's company with less apprehension</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">avoid regrets regarding consequential interaction choices</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">gain more time, until treatments and vaccines are developed, and until our societies have a better chance to adapt to these rapid changes</span>  

*   <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">prevent suffering for those of us who are at a higher risk of various privations</span>
