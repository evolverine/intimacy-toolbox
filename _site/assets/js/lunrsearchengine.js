    "body": "Hi!Welcome. The page you’re looking at is the tentative, and ever-evolving response to the question how can we reencounter ourselves in connection and intimacy in a world of COVID-19 without leaving anyone behind? There’s no one ‘solution’, of course, but there can hopefully be space for learning, for getting clear about our values and some of our facts, and taking it from there with care and openness. If something evident is missing or incomplete, do get in touch and let’s make this trip less rocky together. The COCO PledgeI call it a pledge, but maybe “statement of intention” or even “conversation starter” can define it better. It’s meant to help us get on the same page, which is tricky these days. Read the COCO pledge Other resourcesA collection of articles with resources that may come in handy - for communication, doing relationships better, managing emotions, etc. Read them here "

    "body": "About the COCO pledgeMy hope in writing it: I was imagining this dialogue  “How do you want intimacy to work between us now?”  “I… I’m not exactly sure; it feels so complicated! I don’t really know where to start…” and hoping it could sometimes continue this way  …“but I read this thing last night called the Coco Pledge, and it’s giving me some ideas. ”  “The Coco Pledge?”  “Yeah, it’s… I’d say it’s a bunch of values and assumptions around intimacy in times of COVID; it won’t give us the magic formula, but I think it can start a good conversation. Shall we go through what we like and don’t like about it, and see where that takes us?”  “Sounds good. Shall I read it now?”  “Yeah, it’s not super long. ” Why “COCO”?: “Connection and communication in times of COVID-19” About the resourcesI realised that the pledge by itself could have been, in some situations, even more frustrating than nothing at all. It presupposes and requires certain abilities and perspectives around a host of topics like communication, care, a political approach to relationships, etc. So I wanted to include some of these resources to make it that much more likely that the world we want can be built right now, one interaction at a time.

    "body": "What’s the story with this pledge? Read about it here. And for the text that’s hard to read, just click on it and it will magically reveal itself! Because I acknowledge that   I am deeply connected to strangers, so my behaviours affect those far removed. Also,     My choices of how to connect with others impact the lives of everyone close to me. For example, due to my behaviours, a friend I interact with might be perceived as higher risk by their own friends.     My knowledge isn’t perfect, and I’m likely to exaggerate it     Our collective knowledge about COVID-19 is evolving rapidly     People are affected by the situation in different ways, and to different degrees     Pre-existing inequalities and oppressions, along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, education, sex, age, wealth, religion, political or ethical convictions, etc. might be compounded and magnified by the crises we are traversing     It can be easy to exclude those most at risk unless we actively prevent it. For example, those who are currently suffering from COVID-19 might struggle with multiple limitations and hardships, as well as those with a higher perceived risk, who might see some of their social support gravitate away from them.     Perceptions of risk are important. While it’s clearly useful to allow the best knowledge to influence my risk perception, I can never know all the factors and values that entered others’ risk perceptions.  I want to do my best by others by   learning — and regularly updating my knowledge — about COVID-19 and the recommended measures in my area. SARS-CoV-2: things like mean incubation time, mean number of days the virus has been found present in people’s bodies, symptoms, means of transmission, the extent of asymptomatic transmission, etc. My local context: the recommended safety measures at home, at work, while socializing, etc.     responding with gratitude when others point to information I didn’t know, and being open to changing my mind when faced with better knowledge.     being open and gentle in discussions about “what scientists currently know”, as I know that’s a very fluid area; or about whether the relevant institutions have recommended “good enough” measures. I recognize that’s not easy to ascertain, even for those with extensive knowledge and experience.     carefully checking the sources what I pass onto others. In particular, by not spreading information that I have not received from visible and trusted sources.     deciding which social behaviours feel reasonable and acceptable for me from and with others, given my needs, risk perception, ethics, etc. Around physical touch, gatherings, measures at work, etc. Questions like what information I’d like to know before engaging in various behaviours, my own privacy needs, etc.     not initiating hugs, kisses, handshakes, or other close contact greetings with unless I know the limits and risk management desires of the recipients.     asking about, and welcoming others’ limits, choices of interaction, risk perception, etc. And, of course, respecting them!     not shaming or stigmatizing myself and others for their choices.     not pressuring myself and others into changing.     connecting and offering to help with what I can to compensate for the isolation and disregard that some in my network are likely to experience. From calls to (perhaps physically-distant) walks, to help with shopping, to lending or gifting resources, to setting up book clubs, and so on. In particular,     actively discovering mutually satisfying activities, especially with those at higher risk, or those with more limits and limitations to their freedom.     being open and honest about my own physical state when and where that’s relevant. In particular,     getting tested, when possible and relevant, (if I run a high risk, say, due to my work, or when relevant symptoms appear), and     telling my recent and future contacts when I develop symptoms or test positive*     telling my recent and future contacts when someone I’ve been in contact with has developed symptoms or acted in risky ways, as soon as I am made aware, all while doing my best to ask about and respect the privacy needs of all those involved  … so that together we may   enjoy each other’s company with less fear     avoid regrets when it comes to being close to others     gain more time, until treatments and vaccines are developed, and until our societies have a better chance to adapt to these rapid changes     prevent suffering especially for those who are at a higher risk of various privations  * Although here it refers to COVID-19 symptoms, this can apply to other infectious illnesses as well.
