# About [the undistancing pledge]({{site.baseurl}}/pledge)

### My hope in writing it

I was imagining this dialogue

> "How do you want intimacy to work between us now?"

>  "I... I'm not exactly sure; it feels so complicated! I don't really know where to start..."

and hoping it could sometimes continue this way

> ..."but I read this thing last night called the Undistancing Pledge, and it's giving me some ideas."

>  "The Undistancing Pledge?"

>  "Yeah, it's... I'd say it's a bunch of values and assumptions around intimacy in times of COVID; it won't give us the magic formula, but I think it can start a good conversation. Shall we go through what we like and don't like about it, and see where that takes us?"

>  "Sounds good. Shall I read it now?"

>  "Yeah, it's not super long."

# About [the resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources)

I realised that the pledge by itself could have been, in some situations, even more frustrating than nothing at all. It presupposes and requires certain abilities and perspectives around a host of topics like communication, care, a political approach to relationships, etc. So I wanted to include some of these resources to make it that much more likely that the world we want can be built right now, one interaction at a time.
