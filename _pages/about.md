## Objectives


*   To suggest a measure that may help us protect and support each other and ourselves. Not only in navigating the virus, but also through the psychological or economic hardship that may accompany it.  
    
*   To help start a conversation with our loved ones about our lives together in the age of COVID-19\. There is definitely no assumption that it can apply equally well to everyone, or that one has to agree with all the points.  

## Target audience

Those wishing to be conscious how and with whom they share intimacy, in order to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities from the risks of COVID-19.  


## How to read the pledge  

Eventually the pledge should appear on its own website, and the current ideas for how it will be structured are:  

*   The parts of the text marked with a larger font will likely be the only ones shown when that website loads, and the smaller text that accompanies them will be accessed by clicking on those main pledge items.  

*   In contrast, the text in bold in the acknowledgements section will be emphasized in some way, yet it will be shown alongside the non-bold text.  

*   There is a version number at the top of this document. This will increment as changes are made. From a more advanced, stable version onward, all the changes will be recorded.  

## How you can help  

*   By leaving comments on the parts that you think can be improved, regarding both content and structure.  

*   By suggesting links (to articles, Wikipedia pages, news items, etc.) that illustrate the points made.  

*   By offering your help with translating the pledge (when it is in a publishable state) in a language you are fluent in. To let us know you are able to support us in this, please write an email to 2a5464d3 at opayq.com, indicating the target language.  

*   Through other ways that we can't anticipate üôÇÔ∏è
