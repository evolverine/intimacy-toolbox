# Because I can see and acknowledge that ...  


*   [**I am are more connected to strangers than it may appear**](https://youtu.be/X0mHf3oSUdU), and that my behaviours affect people far removed from my immediate surroundings; In particular, in these times,

*   **My "private" choices of how and with whom to relate have a direct and immediate impact in the lives of all those I connect with**. For example, due to my behaviours, a friend I interact with might be perceived as higher risk by their own friends.
    
*   **My knowledge isn't perfect**, and [I'm likely to exaggerate it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)  

*   Our collective **knowledge about COVID-19 is evolving and changing rapidly**  

*   **People are affected by the situation in different ways**, to different degrees

*   **Pre-existing inequalities and oppressions** that affect those in our lives, along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, education, sex, age, wealth, religion, political or ethical convictions, etc. **might be compounded and magnified** by the crisis we are traversing

*   **Unless I and others are careful, it can be easy to exclude those most at risk**. For example, those who are currently suffering from COVID-19 might struggle with multiple limitations and hardships, as well as those with a higher perceived risk, who might see some of their social support gravitate away from them

*   **Perceptions of risk are important**. While it's undoubtedly useful to allow the best knowledge I can obtain to influence my risk perception, I can never know all the factors and values that entered another's assessment of risk
    

# I want to do my best by others by ...  


*   **learning** — and regularly reviewing the quickly evolving information — **about COVID-19 and the recommended measures in my area**. <span class="spoiler">About SARS-CoV-2 things like mean incubation time, mean number of days the virus has been found present in people's bodies, symptoms, ways of transmission, etc. About my local context — the recommended safety measures at home, at work, while socializing, etc.</span>

*   **responding with gratitude** when others point to information I didn't know, and being open to changing my mind when faced with better knowledge.

*   **being open and gentle in discussions** <span class="spoiler">about "what scientists currently know", as I know that's a very fluid arena; or about whether the relevant institutions have recommended "good enough" measures. I recognize that's not easy to ascertain, even for those with extensive knowledge and experience.</span>

*   **being thorough in verifying the sources of the information** I pass onto others, and, in particular, by not spreading information that I have not received from visible and trusted sources.

*   **deciding for myself which social behaviours feel reasonable and acceptable from and with others**, given my needs, risk perception, ethics, and other relevant factors. <span class="spoiler">Things like physical touch, gatherings, measures at work, etc. Questions like what information I'd like to know before engaging in various behaviours, my own privacy needs, etc.</span>

*   **avoiding initiating hugs, kisses, handshakes, or other close contact greetings with people** unless I know their limits and risk management desires.

*   **asking about, and welcoming others' limits, choices of interaction, risk perception**, etc. And, of course, respecting them.

*   **refraining from shaming or stigmatizing** myself and others for their choices and needs.

*   **refraining from pressuring** myself and others into changing.

*   compensating the isolation and disregard that some in my network are likely to experience, by **connecting and offering to help with what I can**. <span class="spoiler">From calls to (perhaps physically-distant) walks, to help with shopping, to lending or gifting resources, to setting up book clubs, the sky is the limit. </span>In particular,  

*   **being proactive to creatively discover mutually satisfying activities**, especially with those at higher risk, or those with more limits and limitations to their freedom.

*   **being forthcoming about my own physical status** when and where that's relevant. In particular,  

*   **getting tested, when possible and relevant**, (if I run a high risk, say, due to my work, or when relevant symptoms appear), and  

*   **communicating to my recent and future contacts when I develop symptoms or test positive\***

*   **communicating to my recent and future contacts when someone I've been in contact with has developed symptoms or engaged in high risk behaviour**, as soon I am made aware, all while doing my best to ask about and respect the privacy needs of all those involved  

# ...so that together we may  

*   **enjoy each other's company** with less apprehension  

*   **avoid regrets** regarding our interaction choices  

*   **gain more time**, until treatments and vaccines are developed, and until our societies have a better chance to adapt to these rapid changes  

*   **prevent suffering** especially for those who are at a higher risk of various privations
