# Because I can see and acknowledge that ...  


*   [**I am are more connected to strangers than it may appear**](https://youtu.be/X0mHf3oSUdU), and that my behaviours affect people far removed from my immediate surroundings; In particular, in these times,

*   **My "private" choices of how and with whom to relate have a direct and immediate impact in the lives of all those I connect with**. For example, due to my behaviours, a friend I interact with might be perceived as higher risk by their own friends.
    
*   **My knowledge isn't perfect**, and [I'm likely to exaggerate it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)  

*   Our collective **knowledge about COVID-19 is evolving and changing rapidly**  

*   **People are affected by the situation in different ways**, to different degrees

*   **Pre-existing inequalities and oppressions** that affect those in our lives, along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, education, sex, age, wealth, religion, political or ethical convictions, etc. **might be compounded and magnified** by the crisis we are traversing

*   **Unless I and others are careful, it can be easy to exclude those most at risk**. For example, those who are currently suffering from COVID-19 might struggle with multiple limitations and hardships, as well as those with a higher perceived risk, who might see some of their social support gravitate away from them

*   **Perceptions of risk are important**. While it's undoubtedly useful to allow the best knowledge I can obtain to influence my risk perception, I can never know all the factors and values that entered another's assessment of risk
    

# I want to do my best by others by ...  


*   **learning** — and regularly reviewing the quickly evolving information — **about COVID-19 and the recommended measures in my area**. <span class="spoiler">About SARS-CoV-2 things like mean incubation time, mean number of days the virus has been found present in people's bodies, symptoms, means of transmission, the extent of asymptomatic transmission, etc. About my local context — the recommended safety measures at home, at work, while socializing, etc.</span>

*   **responding with gratitude** when others point to information I didn't know, and being open to changing my mind when faced with better knowledge.

*   **being open and gentle in discussions** <span class="spoiler">about "what scientists currently know", as I know that's a very fluid arena; or about whether the relevant institutions have recommended "good enough" measures. I recognize that's not easy to ascertain, even for those with extensive knowledge and experience.</span>

*   **being thorough in verifying the sources of the information** I pass onto others, and, in particular, by not spreading information that I have not received from visible and trusted sources.

*   **deciding for myself which social behaviours feel reasonable and acceptable from and with others**, given my needs, risk perception, ethics, and other relevant factors. <span class="spoiler">Things like physical touch, gatherings, measures at work, etc. Questions like what information I'd like to know before engaging in various behaviours, my own privacy needs, etc.</span>

*   **avoiding initiating hugs, kisses, handshakes, or other close contact greetings with people** unless I know their limits and risk management desires.

*   **asking about, and welcoming others' limits, choices of interaction, risk perception**, etc. And, of course, respecting them.

*   **refraining from shaming or stigmatizing** myself and others for their choices and needs.

*   **refraining from pressuring** myself and others into changing.

*   compensating the isolation and disregard that some in my network are likely to experience, by **connecting and offering to help with what I can**. <span class="spoiler">From calls to (perhaps physically-distant) walks, to help with shopping, to lending or gifting resources, to setting up book clubs, the sky is the limit. </span>In particular,  

*   **being proactive to creatively discover mutually satisfying activities**, especially with those at higher risk, or those with more limits and limitations to their freedom.

*   **being forthcoming about my own physical status** when and where that's relevant. In particular,  

*   **getting tested, when possible and relevant**, (if I run a high risk, say, due to my work, or when relevant symptoms appear), and  

*   **communicating to my recent and future contacts when I develop symptoms or test positive\***

*   **communicating to my recent and future contacts when someone I've been in contact with has developed symptoms or engaged in high risk behaviour**, as soon I am made aware, all while doing my best to ask about and respect the privacy needs of all those involved  

# ...so that together we may  

*   **enjoy each other's company** with less apprehension  

*   **avoid regrets** regarding our interaction choices  

*   **gain more time**, until treatments and vaccines are developed, and until our societies have a better chance to adapt to these rapid changes  

*   **prevent suffering** especially for those who are at a higher risk of various privations
