# Because I acknowledge that


*   [**I am deeply connected to strangers**](https://youtu.be/X0mHf3oSUdU), so my behaviours affect those far removed. Also,

*   **My choices of how to connect with others impact the lives of everyone close to me**. <span class="spoiler">For example, due to my behaviours, a friend I interact with might be perceived as higher risk by their own friends.</span>
    
*   **My knowledge isn't perfect**, and [I'm likely to exaggerate it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)  

*   Our collective **knowledge about COVID-19 is evolving rapidly**

*   **People are affected by the situation in different ways**, and to different degrees

*   **Pre-existing inequalities and oppressions**, along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, education, sex, age, wealth, religion, political or ethical convictions, etc. **might be compounded and magnified** by the crises we are traversing

*   **It can be easy to exclude those most at risk** <span class="spoiler">unless we actively prevent it. For example, those who are currently suffering from COVID-19 might struggle with multiple limitations and hardships, as well as those with a higher perceived risk, who might see some of their social support gravitate away from them.</span>

*   **Perceptions of risk are important**. <span class="spoiler">While it's clearly useful to allow the best knowledge to influence my risk perception, I can never know all the factors and values that entered others' risk perceptions.</span>
    

# I want to do my best by others by


*   **learning** — and regularly updating my knowledge — **about COVID-19 and the recommended measures in my area**. <span class="spoiler">SARS-CoV-2: things like mean incubation time, mean number of days the virus has been found present in people's bodies, symptoms, means of transmission, the extent of asymptomatic transmission, etc. My local context: the recommended safety measures at home, at work, while socializing, etc.</span>

*   **responding with gratitude** when others point to information I didn't know, and being open to changing my mind when faced with better knowledge.

*   **being open and gentle in discussions** <span class="spoiler">about "what scientists currently know", as I know that's a very fluid area; or about whether the relevant institutions have recommended "good enough" measures. I recognize that's not easy to ascertain, even for those with extensive knowledge and experience.</span>

*   **carefully checking the sources** what I pass onto others. <span class="spoiler">In particular, by not spreading information that I have not received from visible and trusted sources.</span>

*   **deciding which social behaviours feel reasonable and acceptable for me** from and with others, given my needs, risk perception, ethics, etc. <span class="spoiler">Around physical touch, gatherings, measures at work, etc. Questions like what information I'd like to know before engaging in various behaviours, my own privacy needs, etc.</span>

*   **not initiating hugs, kisses, handshakes, or other close contact greetings** with unless I know the limits and risk management desires of the recipients.

*   **asking about, and welcoming others' limits, choices of interaction, risk perception**, etc. And, of course, respecting them!

*   **not shaming or stigmatizing** myself and others for their choices.

*   **not pressuring** myself and others into changing.

*   **connecting and offering to help with what I can** to compensate for the isolation and disregard that some in my network are likely to experience. <span class="spoiler">From calls to (perhaps physically-distant) walks, to help with shopping, to lending or gifting resources, to setting up book clubs, and so on. </span>In particular,

*   **actively discovering mutually satisfying activities**, especially with those at higher risk, or those with more limits and limitations to their freedom.

*   **being open and honest about my own physical state** when and where that's relevant. In particular,  

*   **getting tested, when possible and relevant**, (if I run a high risk, say, due to my work, or when relevant symptoms appear), and  

*   **telling my recent and future contacts when I develop symptoms or test positive\***

*   **telling my recent and future contacts when someone I've been in contact with has developed symptoms or acted in risky ways**<span class="spoiler">, as soon as I am made aware, all while doing my best to ask about and respect the privacy needs of all those involved</span>

# ... so that together we may  

*   **enjoy each other's company** with less fear

*   **avoid regrets** when it comes to being close to others

*   **gain more time**, until treatments and vaccines are developed, and until our societies have a better chance to adapt to these rapid changes  

*   **prevent suffering** especially for those who are at a higher risk of various privations


\* Although here it refers to [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3), this can apply to other infectious illnesses as well.
