# How you can help  

*   By [suggesting what you think can be improved](https://github.com/evolverine/intimacy-toolbox/issues), regarding both content and structure.  

*   By [suggesting links](https://github.com/evolverine/intimacy-toolbox/issues) (to articles, Wikipedia pages, news items, etc.) that illustrate and go deeper into the points made in [the pledge]({{site.baseurl}}/pledge) and elsewhere.

*   By [offering your help with translating the pledge](https://github.com/evolverine/intimacy-toolbox/issues/1) in a language you are fluent in.

*   Through other ways that we can't anticipate 🙂️  

Many thanks for your feedback!
